title: How to Build a Static Website Pipeline on AWS

This first post shows how I built this blog and how I used AWS tools like CodePipeline, S3, and CloudFront to implement a continuous delivery pipeline.

I want to keep it as simple as possible, so instead of using Wordpress or any other content manager that requires a database server, I decided to use a static website generator. After doing quick research I found a popular static generator called Jekyll, and it has a reasonable amount of themes available.

I decided to go with Jekyll and use a theme called The Plain.

#### Setup the Jekyll's Theme

First of all, I forked the Jekyll's theme "The Plain" on GitHub. Then, I have configured it by editing the "\_config.yml" file.

The first step was to fork the theme project on Github, configure it and commit the modifications to my Git repository.

1. Fork the repository https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain.git
2. Edit the "\_config.yml" file
3. Create a new blog post by creating a file inside the "\_posts" directory
4. Test it locally
5. Commit and push to the remote Git repository

```bash
git clone https://your_repo_url
cd repo_name
gem bundle install
jekyll serve
```

#### Infrastructure Components

Now that you have a good idea of how it works, it is time to build the AWS infrastructure to host it. Here is the bill of materials for this project.

| Product       | Usage           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Jekyll     | Generate the static content files |
| AWS S3     | Host the static content generated by Jekyll |
| AWS CloudFront      | Provide a content distribution network for our website |
| AWS CodePipeline | Provide a pipeline engine to perform continuous delivery |
| AWS CodeBuild | Build the static website with Jekyll and copy it to the hosting S3 bucket |
| AWS CloudFormation | Creates the infrastructure as code on AWS |

#### Infrastructure Components

To keep everything as code, I created a CloudFormation template to generate the whole infrastructure on AWS.

**NOTE:** The CloudFront distribution takes some time to create. While the CloudFormation creates the stack, take a coffee and relax.


#### Continuous Delivery Pipeline

Our Continuous Delivery Pipeline will be responsible to update our Blog when a blog post is created, edited or removed from the Git repository.

Source Code => Generate the static website files => Copy the static website files to the S3 bucket => Invalidate objects from CloudFront cache

| Step       | Usage           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Source Code | When code is committed and pushed to the Master branch of our Git repository it triggers the AWS CodePipeline to download the source code and store it in a S3 bucket used by the pipeline. |
| Generate the static website files | AWS Code Build is started to run the "jekyll build" command and generate the static content |
| Copy the static website files to the S3 bucket | After the static content is generated, then the AWS Code Build copies the files to the S3 bucket where our site is hosted |
| Invalidate objects from CloudFront cache | As last step, the AWS Code Build calls the CloudFront API to invalidate the objects from cache. This steps is necessary to make sure users get the last version when they access the Blog page |

#### Pricing

This whole infrastructure can be create virtually for free.
